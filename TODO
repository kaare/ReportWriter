TODOs

- Translations
  Start with relevant tests for column, field, total_column
  Finish var substitution, functions
  Standard vars, pagenumber, pageof(?), today(?)
  Could be objects, so today could do today->ymd etc
- Roleify Config, add roles PDF, Page, etc.
  New attribute, type - same as for Output
  Autocalc height
  Calculate correct starty for 2nd body headers
- Make unit conversion to a role if attributes can have multiple getters.
- End report
  Last totals need to be finished.

Laters

- Move header, footer, body into page section. Both yml and Config.pm

  Topline, underline
  Images, logos
  Boxes, normal, rounded, shaded

  Totals, shadowing rows.
  Right now there's only one total, what if we have more rows.
  Perhaps totals could need more loving care. How about labels and stuff
- PDF Output
  Use a ready made PDF layout as background
- All report types
  PDF, Text, HTML, Ooo, Excel, etc
- Figure out if page is adequate for sheet based reports too
  Can containers be used as a kind of row statement

Clean ups

- Tests
  Not all objects have tests now
  Tests for all report types
  Tests for multi level totals

Before release

- Adequate documentation

Maybes

- Autoloader for ReportWriter objects, i.e. 'use ReportWriter :all' or sth
